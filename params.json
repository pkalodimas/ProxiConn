The intention of this project was the implementation of a «proxi» server that handles the geographical position of its clients and informs them which are theirs proximate ones. This is an outdoors project by the meaning of the technological means required. Mobile devices are the most familiar and widely used technology devices meeting the requirements of this project. The GPS, WWAN and WAN technologies are all supported by the synchronous «smart» mobile devices. The main constraint for this project is the instability and the low bandwidth capabilities of the corresponding technologies when used outdoors and on the move.\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\nThe implementation of the ProxiConn project required the cooperation of multiple systems.\r\n- For the mobile clients an application was developed in Objective C for iOS devices (iPhone). The iOS version used was iOS 7.x and tested in the iPhone 4 mobile device. The ProxiConn client application was released in the Apple AppStore market for free during the year 2014. Now is not available anymore.\r\n- For the stable clients a client-side web application was developed running on the browser using JavaScript.\r\n- On the server side a web application was developed using PHP connected with a MySQL database.\r\n\r\n###Links\r\n- [ProxiConn Project Code](https://github.com/pkalodimas/ProxiConn/archive/code.zip)\r\n- [ProxiConn Documentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/ProxiConn/raw/documentation/Documentation/ProxiConn%20Project.pdf)\r\n- [EXEHON Documentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/ProxiConn/raw/documentation/Documentation/%CE%95%CE%9E%CE%95%CE%A7%CE%A9%CE%9D.pdf)\r\n",
